## Task-1 Analysing resume dataset 
This task was given to me by manager Vaibhav Vashishtha sir he told me to take sample dataset of resume of the candidates and do data analytics on that to get ats related data and insights.

### What we did????
- Took a sample data set of resume from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)  ((job-descripton.csv))
- Downloaded the sample data from the above link
- In anaconda launched jupyter,it will open in chrome
- in jupyter opened a the folder where it was kept
- created a python file inside the folder
- code: read csv file and coded different things to analyse data and plot graphs
- the python file is called atsAnalysis.ipynb
- the code file has the code that was used in atsAnalysis.ipynb since to run atsAnalysis.ipynb we need job-description.csv which I cannot upload here since its way too large(we generally do analysis of gigantic data ;)) and it is exceeding the limit so I am uploading the code as it is in code file one is in code.py file and one is in code.txt file in code folder. You can use whatever works for you.
  
### How did I extracted only code from jupyter notebook
- go to that jupyter notebook 
- click on file button at top left
- click download as .py file
- hurray! its done
- use this youtube tutorial for reference(https://youtu.be/K1n4HBCIeOI?feature=shared)
