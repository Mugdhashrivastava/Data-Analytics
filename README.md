# Data Analytics 


Data analytics is the process of examining large sets of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making and drive business strategies.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL
- MS Excel
- ML and AI 
and many more depending upon the type of data 


## Process of Data Analytics

## Data Analytics Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from various sources, which may include databases, APIs, files, or streaming sources.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and integrity.

3. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and relationships between variables through statistical summaries, visualizations, and ** exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

4. **Data Preparation**: Transforming and reshaping the data into a suitable format for analysis, which may involve feature engineering, normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Data Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical methods to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from the data.

6. **Data Visualization**: Presenting the analysis results visually using charts, graphs, and dashboards to facilitate understanding and interpretation by stakeholders.

7. **Interpretation and Communication**: Interpreting the analytical findings in the context of the problem domain, drawing actionable insights, and communicating the results effectively to stakeholders through reports, presentations, or interactive tools.

8. **Iteration and Improvement**: Iteratively refining the analysis based on feedback, incorporating new data, adjusting models or assumptions, and continuously improving the analytics process to drive better decision-making and outcomes.


### How to get started??
I personally started with learning python, I already know other languages like java , javascript and I also work with DSA since I am a developer so I already know logics I wanted to get to know the syntax and flow so I started with this playlist in youtube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV0_puRO1u4&list=PLrN_S08trZepom2bLaBTt0QQt2XnmC7dc)

### Installation
1. I installed latest version of python on my windows system with windows 11 pro, no need to set environment variable. I just need to make sure that my system had python in it.
I used this tutorial [download python](https://youtu.be/m9I-YpOjXVQ?feature=shared)

  - Check if it is installed or not by typing this command in cmd or terminal
```bash
python --version
```

2. Next up I downloaded Anaconda navigator to use jupyter notebook. I could have downloaded jupyter only but anaconda navigator is useful in using and launching other libraries and notebooks too.I used [this](https://youtu.be/UTqOXwAi1pE?feature=shared) tutorial.
